Personal Message from Author:

This project has 15 files as we were instructed by the TAs to organize this to an extent
So, for some files, you may see a lot of lines or not as much lines.

The purpose of that was to group it in such a way that it had a common theme
such as creating or deleting.

Keep in mind, not all files are short as some required for functions to be all connected
in order to work.

Also, this code uses a FileHandler which created functions that passes in parameters, so
for example, creating a file requires calling in the function itself.
Keep in mind it is a big file
as it needed to be together for all the themes to match and the variables to work

Because of its size, the UML is also very huge and I used PlantUML in IntelliJ which
only included horizontal option. However, all the inheritance pointers(->) are there.
If you cannot see it, zoom in the png file.
The arrows means that the parent class
is pointing at the child class
